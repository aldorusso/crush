# Atelier: Hedi Slimane

In a world obsessed with the 'next', Hedi Slimane remains obsessed with the 'eternal'. We sat down in his sun-drenched atelier to discuss the intersection of rock-and-roll heritage and the new luxury of silence.

## The Process of Refinement

"I don't look at trends," Slimane notes, his hands tracing the edge of a vintage leather jacket. "I look at the way a sleeve falls when someone is tired. I look at the way light hits a button at 4 PM."

### The Saint-Tropez Light

Minimalism isn't an absence, it's a profound presence. The Saint-Tropez atelier serves as both a sanctuary and a laboratory for these experiments in light and shadow.
