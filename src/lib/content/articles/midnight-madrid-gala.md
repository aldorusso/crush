# After Hours: Madrid Art Gala

The sun had long since dipped below the horizon of the Gran Vía when the heavy oak doors of the Palacio de Cristal swung open for a chosen few. What followed was a masterclass in modern curation, light, and the electric pulse of the Madrid night.

## The Aesthetic of the Night

Under the flicker of a thousand candles, the lines between guest and art became blurred. Our cameras captured the raw, unfiltered essence of a night where style was the only currency.

### Highlights

- The Neon Installation by Ruiz
- Private Performance in the North Wing
- Estilo Vanguardista: A Study in Black
